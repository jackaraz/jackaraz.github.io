title: "Simplified fast detector simulation in MadAnalysis 5"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/SFS
excerpt: 'We introduce a new simplified fast detector simulator in the MadAnalysis 5 platform. The Python-like interpreter of the programme has been augmented by new commands allowing for a detector parametrisation through smearing and efficiency functions. On run time, an associated C++ code is automatically generated and executed to produce reconstructed-level events. In addition, we have extended the MadAnalysis 5 recasting infrastructure to support our detector emulator and provide predefined LHC detector configurations. We have compared predictions obtained with our approach to those from the Delphes 3 software, both for Standard Model processes and a few new physics signals. Results generally agree to a level of about 10% or better, although Delphes 3 is 30% to 50% slower and requires 100 times more disk space.'
